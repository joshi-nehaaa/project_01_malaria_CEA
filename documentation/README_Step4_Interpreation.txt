Step 4: Interpretation & Executive Summary

Objective: 
	Translate the quantitative results of the cost-effectiveness model into clear insights and recommendations for decision-making.

Data Sources: 
	File impact_model_2021.xlsx: outputs and visuals

Steps: 
	1. Create new sheet executive_summary_2021 & include the following data in a 2x2 grid:
		Title & Key Results
		Chart: Cost per DALY Averted by Zone
		Insights & Implications
		Data Sources & Assumptions
	2. Incorporated qualitative findings (non-reasons) to interpret performance variation.

Key Findings: 
	Northern zones demonstrate higher ITN usage and greater cost-effectiveness due to behavioral compliance.
	Southern zones show higher non-use linked to perceived risk, leading to lower efficiency.
	ITN distribution remains a highly cost-effective intervention.
